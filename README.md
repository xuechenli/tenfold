# Tenfold

## 1. [Critique](https://github.com/xuechenli/tenfold/blob/master/critique.pdf)
I did a little critique of the current website design. To my humble opinion, the current design is good at showing details of the products and the trust from our clients. But the most important things: how it works and why should the visitor choose it are not presented clearly. The visitor will only stay for seconds before they lose interest. This information must be standing out enough.

## 2. [Design](https://github.com/xuechenli/tenfold/blob/master/Tenfold.sketch)
I think using a video in the header to show how the product works would be better. A moving image would attract the visitor's attention the most. My idea for the new design is to emphasize on the simplicity of the integration and the power of the analytics tool. The second section in the Sketch file is the concept of showing the details of the integration. The floating zoom-in images around the central image would fade in when visitor scroll down. For other part of the homepage that I haven't designed, my thought is to put the client example and quotes to one place. 

## 3. Website mock-up
I used a very light framwork called [Skel](https://github.com/ajlkn/skel). And I tried to implement [this responsive navigation bar effect](http://codepen.io/rugor/pen/wayJQY) but it didn't work out well. I think it is because this example is referring a JS plugin and I haven't figured out how to use it. 🤷
